    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Wilson HernÃ¡ndez, a developer in training passionate about technology and innovation. I have solid knowledge in programming languages like C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, plus experience developing applications with Node.js and modern frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, and Express.js. I handle relational databases like SQL Server, MySQL, and Oracle, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB, which allows me to design and build complete solutions from backend to frontend. I consider myself a curious, self-taught person focused on continuous improvement. My goal is to become a versatile programmer, capable of developing scalable projects with real impact.\n\nI am characterized by being self-taught, disciplined, and passionate about reading. I constantly seek to learn new technologies and apply what I learn in real projects.\n\nWhen I disconnect from the keyboard, I like to go for walks and enjoy the fresh air. I believe that walking not only clears the mind, but also stimulates creativity and improves mental health, something essential to stay inspired day by day."
